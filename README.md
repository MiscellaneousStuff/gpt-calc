# gpt-calc

## About

Simple CLI tool to see if having a subscription or just using the API would be cheaper based on your ChatGPT usage.

## TODO

- [x] Extract user conversations from ChatGPT exported `conversation.json`
- [ ] Use tiktoken to calculate exact token usage per month
- [ ] Determine if cost is higher or lower than subscription cost

## NOTE

Code assumes all usage is GPT-4 for now.
